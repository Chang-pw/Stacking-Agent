        "description": "The molecule is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion that is the conjugate base of dTDP-beta-L-rhodosamine, arising from deprotonation of the diphosphate group and protonation of the amino group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a dTDP-beta-L-rhodosamine.",
        "answer": "The molecule is Sulfentrazone, a member of the class of triazoles that is 5-oxo-1,2,4-triazole substituted at positions 1, 3, and 4 by 2,4-dichloro-5-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]phenyl, methyl, and difluoromethyl groups, respectively. It is a protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor used as a herbicide to control broad-leaved weeds in soya and tobacco crops, not approved for use within the European Union. It acts as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, a herbicide, and an agrochemical. It is a sulfonamide, a dichlorobenzene, an organofluorine compound, and a member of triazoles.",
