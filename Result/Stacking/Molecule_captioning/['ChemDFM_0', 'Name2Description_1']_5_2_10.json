    "description": "The molecule is a pyrrolopyrimidine that is 7-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine which has been substituted at position 5 by a 4-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl group, the nitrogen of which has been acylated by a (6-methylpyridin-2-yl)acetyl group. An orally bioavailable PERK inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 3.1.3.48 (protein-tyrosine-phosphatase) inhibitor, a PERK inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pyrrolopyrimidine, a biaryl, a member of indoles, a member of methylpyridines, an organofluorine compound and a tertiary carboxamide.",
    "answer": "The molecule is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase WEE1 with potential antineoplastic activity. It selectively targets and inhibits WEE1, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, CDC2) to inactivate the CDC2/cyclin B complex. Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis in tumor cells dependent on WEE1 for survival. Most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint, relying on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair. The WEE1 inhibitor MK-3688 may treat cancers resistant to DNA damage induction.",
