Given the SMILES string of a molecule, predict the molecular properties of a given chemical compound based on its structure, by analyzing whether it can inhibit(Yes) the Beta-site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) or cannot inhibit(No) BACE1. Consider factors such as molecular weight, atom count, bond types, and functional groups in order to assess the compound's drug-likeness and its potential to serve as an effective therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, please answer with only Yes or No.\nSMILES: Clc1cc2nc(n(c2cc1)CCCC(=O)N(C)C1CCCCC1)N\nBACE-1 Inhibit:",
