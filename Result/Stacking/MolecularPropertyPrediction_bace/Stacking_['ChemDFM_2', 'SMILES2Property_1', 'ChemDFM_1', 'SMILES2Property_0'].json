Consider factors such as molecular weight, atom count, bond types, and functional groups in order to assess the compound's drug-likeness and its potential to serve as an effective therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, please answer with only Yes or No.\nSMILES: O=C1N(CCCC1)C(C)(C)[C@@H]1C[C@@H](CCC1)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@H](O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(ccc1)C(C)C)Cc1ccccc1\nBACE-1 Inhibit:",
