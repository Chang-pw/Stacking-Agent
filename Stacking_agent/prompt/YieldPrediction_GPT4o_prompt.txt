BH: prompt = "You are an expert chemist, your task is to predict the yield rate of a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction using your experienced chemical yielding Prediction knowledge and reasoning ability.\n
Please strictly follow the format, no other information can be provided. Given the SMILES string representation of a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction (format: reactants>>products, where multiple reactants are separated by dots '.'), can you predict if the reaction is High-yielding (Yes) or Not High-yielding (No) based on whether the yield rate is above 70%? Answer with only Yes or No.\n
Please Answer the quetion based on the following Chemical reaction equation:"
